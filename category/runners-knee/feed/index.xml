										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Runner’s Knee</strong>:<strong> </strong>This common injury plagues active runners. Patellofemoral pain is described as sharp and sudden, or dull and long-lasting. It radiates from below your knee cap, both during and after workouts. One of the best things to do for this issue is to wear a <a href="http://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/knee-support-for-running-and-more/">slip-on knee brace</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1">Practice Myofascial Release<br />
</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Myofascial release is a fancy word for foam rolling, the act of massaging your fascia muscles. This helps relieve pressure from the fascia muscles near the pelvis and around the Iliotibial Band on the outside of your leg which meets with your knees. Foam rollers come in different strengths, from firm to extra firm. Keep in mind, the firmer the foam the more intense and possibly more painful massaging will be. Begin by rolling the foam around the affected muscles, then slowly work toward the most painful sections last &#8211; keep this up for 10 to 20 seconds per quad muscle area.</span></p>
<h2 class="p3">Use Quad-Strengthening Exercises</h2>
<p class="p3">A common catalyst for runner’s knee are weak quads, this is because your quads aren’t able to support your body so it puts pressure and weight on your knees. Add quad strengthening exercises to your workout routine, some examples are: Squats with a Swiss Ball and Leg Extensions with a Band.</p>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1">Reduce Intensity and Frequency of Runs</span></h2>
<p class="p3">If you start experiencing pain from your runner’s knee and it is getting worse, it could be time to slow down your exercise routine. Try running less frequently, and or less intensely. Try water aerobics to ease the pressure on your knees from weak quads, and slowly reintroduce running into your routine while wearing a <a href="http://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/knee-support-for-running-and-more/">knee brace</a>.</p>
