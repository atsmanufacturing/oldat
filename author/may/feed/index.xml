<p style="text-align: left;">No amount of talent, notoriety, or smarts will stop back pain from rearing it&#8217;s ugly head. Here are a few famous victims of the infamous condition&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-3365"></span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center;">Bono</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5528" src="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bono-back-pain-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bono-back-pain-300x200.jpg 300w, https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bono-back-pain-360x240.jpg 360w, https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bono-back-pain.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Bono was afflicted with a herniated disc and severe compression of the sciatic nerve while training for the U.S. leg of U2&#8217;s 360 degrees tour. Thatâ€™s what you get for<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2794347/oops-m-sorry-bono-apologises-u2-album-automatically-added-apple-itunes-libraries-iphone-6-launch.html"> putting your album on my phone,</a> buddy!</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;">America&#8217;s top DILF suffered from a back injury on the set of Syria that was so bad that <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2059563/George-Clooney-I-considered-suicide-agonising-spinal-injury.html">spinal fluid was leaking out of his nose</a>.</p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1">Elizabeth Taylor</span></h3>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;">Born with scoliosis, Elizabeth&#8217;s pain got so bad she developed dependency on alcohol, painkillers, and sleeping pills.<br />
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1369180/Elizabeth-Taylor-8-marriages-50-movies-2-Oscars-100-operations-360m-fortune.html">RIP Elizabeth</a>, thanks for the years of entertainment.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;">While on the set of Seabiscuit, Tobey Maguire developed a back injury from horseback riding. The pain was so bad <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2003/may/11/entertainment/ca-masters11">he almost lost his role as Spiderman for the sequel</a>. (His replacement would have been Jake Gyllenhall.)</p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1">Jerry Lewis</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5532" src="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/jerry-lewis-back-pain-250x300.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="300" srcset="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/jerry-lewis-back-pain-250x300.jpg 250w, https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/jerry-lewis-back-pain-300x361.jpg 300w, https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/jerry-lewis-back-pain.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: left;">Anyone can get a hernia.</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">No amount of wealth, fame, or good looks will stop the small intestine from passing through the abdominal wall. Celebrity or not, hernias happen. Here are just a few well known victims of the infamous condition&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-3223"></span></p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1">David Spade</span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-3234 " src="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/441px-David_Spade-1.jpg" alt="By dodge challenger1 - Image:David Spade in car.jpg, cropped, CC BY 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4184794" width="314" height="426" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">Someone noted on David Spade&#8217;s Wikipedia page that he was an actor and comedy, but no one&#8217;s laughing now. He&#8217;s starred in <em>Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser,Â <i>Lil&#8217; Pimp</i>,</em> and <em>Grown Ups 2</em>. We hope his hernia wasn&#8217;t as bad as his movie choices!</p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1">James Caan</span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-3232 " src="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/449px-James_Caan_1976.jpg" alt="By Hans Peters / Anefo - Nationaal Archief, CC BY-SA 3.0 nl, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=26924023" width="310" height="413" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">Turns out his <em>Wikipedia</em> page isn&#8217;t written in stone, and neither is his Hernia diagnosis. That won&#8217;t make your uncle stop with the <em>Godfather</em> lines at Thanksgiving though.</p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1">Justin Long</span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-3231 " src="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/454px-Justin_Long_TIFF_2011.jpg" alt="By Tony Shek - Justin Long, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=18661745" width="308" height="407" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">An apple a day didn&#8217;t keep his doctor away. Maybe this dude would&#8217;ve had better luck getting a Dell.</p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center;">Jeff Bridges</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-3233 " src="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/509px-Jeff_Bridges_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg" alt="By Gage Skidmore, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=27439660" width="321" height="378" /></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">Jeff Bridges is a popular star, notably from <em>The Big Lebowski</em>. Turns out the dude had more issues on his plate than spilled milk.</p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center;">Dwayne Johnson</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-3235 " src="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Dwayne_Johnson_2_2013.jpg" alt="By Eva Rinaldi - Dwayne Johnson, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=25135388" width="322" height="415" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">As strong as his abdominal wall is, one wrong move can leave you between a rock and a hard place.</p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center;">Madonna</h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-3230 " src="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Madonna_Rebel_Heart_Tour_2015_-_Stockholm_23051472299.jpg" alt="ByÂ chrisweger - Madonna, CC BY-SA 2.0" width="459" height="344" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">America&#8217;s favorite diva is no virgin to pain.</p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1">Daniel Tosh</span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-6146" src="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Daniel_Tosh_at_Boston_University-e1528902042142.jpg" alt="" width="369" height="355" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">America&#8217;s least favorite star of Tosh.0 got a hernia. We&#8217;re guessing he was laughing at his own jokes, because no one else is.</p>
<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1">Bam Margera</span></h3>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-3228 " src="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/800px-Bam_Margera.jpg" alt="By Matt Rogers - Flickr.com (http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattabilly/254385949/), CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1819734" width="462" height="308" /></p>

<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1">Charlie Sheen</span></h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As an expectant parent gets further and further into pregnancy, the weight they must carry grows exponentially. The average size of a baby with forty weeks gestation is seven and a half pounds. Add in any additional pounds gained during the process and your back becomes a hub for stress. When the pain killer options available to you are slim to none, what do you do? Your doctor may recommend doing simple exercises to keep the part of your body moving, and naturally some rest! See three exercises that you can do to help relieve back ache below:</span></p>
<p><span id="more-3194"></span></p>
<h2 class="p1">Core Twists</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Begin by taking a resistance band or a small dumb weight and stand with your arms at shoulder length feet apart. If using a resistance band your foot should be firmly planted on the band to keep it from slipping into you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Next, take your body and twist it in the opposite direction from where youâ€™re standing on the band. You should feel your core engaging. Continue this for 10 to 15 reps, and then switch sides! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> This exercise works by using the muscles in your core, which help support your power back. When your core is strong, your lower back is more supported and the weight of your child is balanced out. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Deadlift to Curl<br />
</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5570" src="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Pregnant-Beers-Shannon20Colwell-THUMB.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="288" srcset="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Pregnant-Beers-Shannon20Colwell-THUMB.jpg 512w, https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Pregnant-Beers-Shannon20Colwell-THUMB-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your feet should begin stride length apart from each other, one side in front of the other. Youâ€™ll want to have a low-weight dumbbell in each hand. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Lean forward and engage your core, with the dumbbells at your side. From here, youâ€™ll want to slowly lift your upper body up while turning the dumbbells into your body. Continue this for five to ten reps then switch sides. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Triangle Pose</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> This position uses the techniques of yoga to help you stretch your body. Begin by takin your feet and putting them a strides length away from each other. Reach out with your arms in each direction. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Next cross your left arm over your right side and stretch. Keep your head level and looking up toward the ceiling, and make sure your arms are a straight as possible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Come back up and cross in the opposite direction. Do this five or six times holding in each position for a while. This will help elongate your body and keep your back relieved of tension.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Let us know how these exercises help, and send us some hints and tips from your own exercise routine! Weâ€™d love to hear about them. In the meantime, check out our store for pregnancy support belts that help manually alleviate pain and support your belly when carrying.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RICE: it&#8217;s not just for dinner! Nearly 25,000 sprained ankles occur every day, so the likelihood of it happening to you is pretty high. Imagine you&#8217;re walking around on the beach, and you step in a spot on the sand that is more uneven than the rest. You roll your ankle and a ligament gets pulled or even worse &#8211; torn. What happens now? You need some sprained ankle support.</p>
<p><span id="more-3120"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">The most important process to follow after a sprained ankle is <strong>RICE</strong>. It goes as follows:</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>R: Rest</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The most important action to take after a sprained ankle, is none at all. </em><br />
<em>Allow your body to have time to heal, and not make the condition even worse than it is. </em><br />
<em>Try to stay off your ankle as much as possible.</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>I: Ice</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A huge concern after an ankle sprain is swelling. </em><br />
<em>This can cause acute pain and worsen the sprained ankle situation. </em><br />
<em>Keeping swelling down is crucial for sprained ankle support.</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>C: Compression</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Keeping the ankle compressed will also help with swelling, as well as supporting the ligaments. </em><br />
<em>Try our compression <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/athletic-injury-compression-wrap/">wraps</a> or <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/athletic-pull-on-mid-calf-ankle-compression-sleeve/">braces.</a></em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>E: Elevation</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>After spraining your ankle, keeping it elevated for 2 to 3 days will reduce bruising and swelling.</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-5581 aligncenter" src="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/emblem-32650_960_720.png" alt="" width="180" height="310" srcset="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/emblem-32650_960_720.png 418w, https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/emblem-32650_960_720-300x517.png 300w, https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/emblem-32650_960_720-174x300.png 174w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px" /></strong></h3>
<p>Following these steps after spraining an ankle will get you started out on the right foot for recovery.. After rest and relaxation most sprains heal on their own. Keeping pain down with a mild over the counter pain reliever might be necessary.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re experiencing extreme pain, heard a pop sound when you sprained your ankle, or see extreme bruising and swelling &#8211; visit your doctor. For extreme cases of sprained ankles or torn ligaments surgery will be a possibility.</p>
<p>The most important part of sprained ankle support, is having patience. Your body will naturally heal itself, but giving it time to rest, relax, and do it&#8217;s job is crucial.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For some of us, incontinence can be a second full-time job. For some it can be an old friend who needs your help at the most inconvenient times. No matter the severity, you cannot mess this up. At work, out on the town, or even in the car; an accident is inconvenient to say the least. We created this guide to help you figure out what you need from your incontinence pants.</p>
<p><span id="more-3110"></span></p>

<li><b>Gender-Specific Design:</b>Â Manufacturers will make different products for the bodies of different people, unless its a structural design, don&#8217;t fall for color marketing gimmicks. <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/pull-on-elastic-waist-incontinence-pants/">Unisex</a> incontinence pants are great for everyone!</li>

<li><b>Moisture Wicking:</b>Â Many incontinence garments have a means of moving water away from the body &#8211; make sure yours makes the cut.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pitching injuries canÂ put a dent in your season for good, and no one likes a bench warmer. Â We&#8217;ve compiled a couple of the most common injuries, symptoms, and supportÂ to help you out.</p>
<p><span id="more-3055"></span></p>
<h2>Rotator Cuff Tendinitis Pitching Injuries</h2>
<p><a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/image327.gif"><img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-5592 " src="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/image327-300x208.gif" alt="" width="430" height="298" /></a>Rotator Cuff Tendinitis is a pitching injury that occurs closest to the shoulder in the arm. This area contains many muscles and tendons that help keep your arm from popping out of your shoulder. However, with age or extra tension (like pitching for years, improper technique, and lack of rest) these parts can become swollen or damaged. If you start feeling pain front and top of your shoulder, or the outer part of the upper arm &#8211; make a doctor&#8217;s appointment to get it looked at. Other symptoms could be loss of motion and/or strength, a clicking noise once the shoulder is raised over your head, or tenderness/swollen muscles in the front of your shoulder. Treatment involves an anti-inflammatory, rest, stretching and mixing <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/hotshotz-portable-heating-pad/">cold and heat therapies</a>. More severe cases will involved physical therapy, and even surgery &#8211; but this is less common.</p>
<h2>Elbow TendinitisÂ Pitching Injuries</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-5593" src="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/image332-136x300.gif" alt="" width="233" height="514" /></p>
<p>Elbow tendinitis is very similar to rotator cuff tendinitis, just found in the elbow instead. Another name used to refer to elbow tendinitis is Tennis Elbow. This injury is very common for pitchers who spend their time throwing fast balls and the like. We go into this condition extensively in our other post; <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/tennis-elbow-treatment/">Tennis Elbow:Â Symptoms, Exercises, &amp; Treatments</a>. We also carry the <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/counterforce-brace-for-tennis-elbow/">counterforce brace.</a></p>
<h2>Medial Elbow Ligament Disruption Pitching Injuries</h2>
<p>The medial elbow ligament is located on the inside of the elbow, its is to provide stability to the joint. Injury occurs, not surprisingly with repetitive overuse &#8211; like throwing. Symptoms include tenderness and pain, on the inside of the elbow &#8211; see your doctor if you find these symptoms after a game. Treatments for MELD include rest and <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/hotshotz-portable-heating-pad/">hot/cold therapies</a>, and for more severe cases surgery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diabetes foot care is not usually a big concern with people, the main concern for those with diabetes is regulating blood sugar. However, to many patients&#8217;Â surprise &#8211; the symptoms do not stop there. Nearly 70 percent of people with diabetes, have some form ofÂ neuropathy. This is damage of the nerves in the hands or feet from poor or low circulation. Symptoms include lose of feeling in the hands and feet, or higher risk of infection. Here are 5Â steps for taking care of your feet with diabetes.</p>
<p><span id="more-3041"></span></p>
<h2>Diabetes Foot Care</h2>
<h2><em>Step 1:<br />
</em>Inspect your feet daily</h2>
<p>Patients should check their feet daily, to make sure no new discolorations, sores, or cracked/dry skin occur. Using a mirror for the under side of your feet, make sure you check the entire foot. Have someone help you if you cannot manage.</p>
<h2><em>Step 2:</em><br />
Check water temperature accurately</h2>
<p>With intensive damage to the nerves of your feet and hands, you might find it harder to know when water is too hot. Hot tubs, baths/showers, and doing dishes can become a huge problem if the water is too hot and you cannot feel it. This can lead to scalding burns and blisters &#8211; which invite infection. Using your elbow will help you keep accurate readings of water temps.</p>
<h2><em>Step 3:</em><br />
Invest in good footwear and socks</h2>
<p>Shoe shopping with a diabetes sufferer can become a real task. Making sure you have the right footwear and accessories is very important. Some tips include: looking for deeper toe boxes, and optimal coverage on the top and bottom of the foot. Also shying away from shoes and socks with seams inside that can rub against your feet. Socks should have padding and be really good at wicking away moisture. Check out our great <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/knee-high-compression-support-stockings-with-closed-toe/">compression socks</a>!</p>
<h2><em>Step 4: </em><br />
Don&#8217;t go barefoot!</h2>
<p>Along with checking water temperatures, you should never go barefoot in your own home. Nerve damage significantly decreases the foot&#8217;s ability to feel for any objects. Stepping on a lego isn&#8217;t a concern, but a thumbtack or getting a splinter becomes deadly. You may not feel the object cut or scrape your foot &#8211; allowing infection to grow and spread.</p>
<h2><em>Step 5: </em><br />
Orthotics are your friend</h2>
<p>Keeping comfort in mind, getting a good pair of inserts can get be helpful. You can find great gel inserts for much less than a new pair of shoes, and for a whole lot more impact. We sell great inserts, like <a href="https://atsurgical.myftpupload.com/product/dual-durometer-silicone-heel-cups/">these</a> or <a href="https://atsurgical.myftpupload.com/product/slim-silicone-insoles-34-thick-metatarsal-pad/">these</a>.</p>
<p>Taking your diabetes care one step at a time is important and helps make it more manageable. Always talk to your doctor for recommendations on new products and treatments that help you overcome the troubles that diabetes brings to your life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Attention for Womenâ€™s Soccer has been building, medical and sports authorities are finding players are at higher risk for more severe concussions than most sports players. This comes at a surprise when compared to more high contact sports like football, and wresting.</p>
<h2><span id="more-3014"></span>Concussion Stats</h2>
<p>New studies have shown that for every 100,000 soccer players, 33 will get a concussion per year. This is fewer than in football, where every game thatâ€™s played &#8211; someone walks away with a concussion. However, scientists are finding that concussions sustained from player soccer are more severe. This is alarming as soccer among girls is becoming increasingly popular, especially after the 2012 London Olympics gold and the continued coverage in the 2016 Rio De Janeiro games.</p>
<h2><a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Concussions-Womens-Soccer.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-5613" src="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Concussions-Womens-Soccer.jpg" alt="" width="379" height="521" srcset="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Concussions-Womens-Soccer.jpg 404w, https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Concussions-Womens-Soccer-300x412.jpg 300w, https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Concussions-Womens-Soccer-218x300.jpg 218w" sizes="(max-width: 379px) 100vw, 379px" /></a>Causes of Concussions</h2>
<p>People might be wondering how soccer players are at more risk for severe concussions compared to football and wrestling. The answer seems simple when you think about it, it&#8217;s all about where the action is. In football there&#8217;s high contact with other players, and in wrestling there&#8217;s a lot a deceleration/acceleration concussions. However,Â in soccer there&#8217;s a lot of balls bouncing on heads and heads accidentally colliding. When players are required to bounce balls off their heads that are soaring at mostÂ 60 mph, you might see where the concern is.</p>
<h2>Ways to Reduce Severity of Concussions</h2>
<p>The best practices to reduce severity of concussions, is to be situationally aware. Soccer players need to practice always being aware of their surroundings. Where are the other player&#8217;s elbows, where is the nearest player to me, where is the ball landing? And perhaps one of the most important practices is to protect the head. Bouncing the ball off the player&#8217;s head should either be phased out as a practice, or we should start equipping our players with helmets. A lot of research has been done on the importance of helmets in reduces concussions in the realm of football, researchers should use this as a jumping off point for soccer players and their unique challenges.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Hamstring strain</strong></h3>
<p>This imminently preventable injury is felt as a sudden sharp pain at the back of the thigh. AÂ hamstring sprain is remedied by cold therapy with a compression wrap applied ASAP for 10-15 minutes every hour for the first day. After this, every 2-3 hours is usually sufficient. Use our <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/bernie-bag-with-hotcold-pack/">bernieÂ bag with the hot/cold pouch</a>Â and ourÂ <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/bandace-elastic-bandage-wraps/">elastic bandage wrap</a>Â for optimal results.</p>
<p><span id="more-2998"></span></p>
<h3><strong>Shin splints</strong></h3>
<p>Also known as medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), shin splints occur when the tendons inside the shin bone swell from overuse. It&#8217;s the least comfortable of the injuries this writer has experienced. It feels like hitting your funny bone with your other funny bone. It&#8217;s a common ailment to affect folks just breaking into running, but don&#8217;t let it discourage you. Doctors recommend giving it 4-6 days to heal before returning to running, but if you continue running, wrap your leg first with anÂ <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/bandace-elastic-bandage-wraps/">elastic bandage wrap</a>Â for a few weeks.</p>
<h3><strong>Ankle sprain</strong></h3>
<p>This common injury typically occurs when the ankle rolls inwards, damaging the ligaments on the outside of the ankle, but the inverse will also occur on occasion. This ailment can be treated with <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/2017/05/11/sprained-ankle-support/">R.I.C.E.: rest, ice, compression, and elevation</a>. Similar to the hamstring strain, this type ofÂ sprain is remedied by cold therapy with a compression wrap applied. It is once again recommended that you use our <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/bernie-bag-with-hotcold-pack/">bernieÂ bag with the hot/cold pouch</a>Â and ourÂ <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/bandace-elastic-bandage-wraps/">elastic bandage wrap</a>Â for optimal results.</p>
<h3><strong>ACL tear</strong></h3>
<p>The torn ACL, or &#8220;anterior cruciate ligament&#8221;, is a common occurrence in sports that require quick-turning, such as soccer or football. Sadly, unlike the sports injuries above, this one is going to require professional help, but the first 72 hours require P.R.I.C.E. and the aforementionedÂ <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/bernie-bag-with-hotcold-pack/">bernieÂ bag with the hot/cold pouch</a>Â andÂ <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/bandace-elastic-bandage-wraps/">elastic bandage wrap</a>Â combo.</p>
<h3><strong>Groin pull</strong></h3>
<p>This tear to the abductor muscle creates pain between the belly and inner thigh that ranges from somewhat tolerable to excruciating. In the first 72 hours, use the AT Surgical patented combo of theÂ <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/bernie-bag-with-hotcold-pack/">bernieÂ bag with the hot/cold pouch</a>Â andÂ <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/bandace-elastic-bandage-wraps/">elastic bandage wrap</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Tennis elbow (epicondylitis)</strong></h3>
<p>Tennis elbow can happen immediately, but unlike the otherÂ injuries listed here, it can also happen over time as a result of the tendon of the wrist extensor muscle becoming inflamed and eventually degeneratedÂ from the movement of tendons where they attach to the elbow. Treatment is a breeze with a <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/tennis-elbow-brace-with-adjustable-neoprene-pads/">counterforce brace</a>, which pulls the tendons away from the elbow to prevent further inflammation. Use the R.I.C.E. method for a winning combo.</p>
