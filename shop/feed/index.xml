										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AT Surgical underpads are washable and extremely comfortable for patients. The material on the top of the bed pad is a soft blend of natural and synthetic fibers. The cotton/polyester blend faces the patient. These underpads are completely leak-proof, making things quite convenient for the nurses and other medical care providers. They can be washed many times and due to being lightweight, they dry quickly. With the reusable underpads that Trifecta offers, it is far easier for a healthcare provider to make a quick change of the underpad rather than of the entire bottom sheet. Also, by using these underpads, the moisture will be absorbed by the pad itself. This keeps the patient dry and prevents the mattresses from being ruined.<br />
Cardinal Reusable quilted cotton-blend dry-touch top layer wicks moisture into the pad protecting the skin and maintaining skin wellness, a poly/rayon super absorbent layer absorbs and traps fluids, and a 100% waterproof vinyl backed polyester backing locks out moisture and staining. Bed Pads have added protection at the center where it is needed most. Machine washable and dry with bleach. Latex-free and lead-free. A non-slip bottom layer keeps the pad flat and in place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AT Surgical Rib Belts For Men &amp; Women Rib Belts For Men &amp; Women helps stabilize rib and sternum fractures by limiting expansion through compression. Rib Belts For Men &amp; Women provides comfort and encourages more controlled breathing to help reduce pain. Rib Belts also provide support and compression to the muscles and soft tissues of the rib cage weakened by strain, trauma, overuse, inactivity, or surgery. Paneled Hinged Stitch: This innovative design has a simulated hinged stitch that creates separate panels for a more conforming, tapered fit with flexibility. Old style panel abdominal binders were connected with an open, crochet-like stitch that easily pinched the skin and left an opening for a swelling pool. Unique hinged stitch eliminates these problems. Latex-Free and Plush Lining: Comfortable and non-irritating for patients and caregivers with latex rubber sensitivities. True Woven Elastic Woven, as opposed to knit elastic, is the premium construction inelastic materials. The woven elastic gives firm and consistent compression power and can be cut without unraveling to accommodate drainage tubes. Hook Compatible Exterior Allows for a wider range of adjustability and easy application. Indications Rib Belts For Men &amp; Women are indicated to support the rib cage and sternum by limiting expansion through compression. Goals Increase rib/sternum compression. Decrease anti-inflammatory medications. Decrease back pain symptoms. Low profile support. Breathable back support.</p>
