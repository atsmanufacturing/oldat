										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Graduated ribbed compression gives you maximum support where you need it, and lighter compression where you don&#8217;t &#8211; resulting in a more comfortable fit. Lighter compression on the calves gradually increases to stronger compression in the ankle and arch regions for greater stability and comfort just where you need it. Increase blood circulation to the muscles while working out by reducing leg fatigue and effects of delayed onset muscle soreness in the days following strenuous exercise, allowing for improved athletic performance and faster recovery periods.</p>
