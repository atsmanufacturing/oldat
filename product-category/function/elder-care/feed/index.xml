					<description><![CDATA[<p>The AT Surgical Gait Belt / Transfer Belt is designed to be a heavy duty weight bearing belt that stays securely in place when fastened. Ensure a layer of clothing is between the patient’s skin and the belt to avoid abrasion. Keep resident as close as possible to caregiver during transfer. The proper way to apply it is to keep two fingers between the belt and the patient’s body. Tighten it until it has just enough room for your fingers. If the belt is too loose you could either have it slip upward and injure the patient’s chest (especially the female patient) or increase your risk for dropping them once the weight is put on the belt. A gait belt should never be used as a restraint or on patients with G-tubes and should be avoided with patients who have catheters.</p>
