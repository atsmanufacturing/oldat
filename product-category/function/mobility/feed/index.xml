					<description><![CDATA[<p>Soft, comfortable, stretchable fabric tubing that is fully lined with a moisturizing gel interior that comforts and cushions sensitive corns, warts, blisters and calluses. Guards against friction and painful irritation from overlapping or rubbing toes. Tubes are capped to offer full protection in typically hard to cover areas. Absorbs shock and pressure better than less effective drugstore foam products that quickly wear out.</p>

<ul>
<li>Elastic sleeve hugs the digit and stays put, so you can wear it in any shoe, closed or open toe, and also when barefoot</li>
<li>Silicone gel cushioning helps prevent blistering and helps to relieve hot spots, such as painful warts, hard or soft corns</li>
<li>Molds to the skin, insulating the sensitive area against shock and pressure</li>
<li>Capped design allows for total protection, even in tough places</li>
<li>Three sizes- 20 mm, 25 mm and 35 mm. 25 mm is suitable for most fingers and 20 mm for toes</li>
<li>Durable, washable (by hand) and reusable</li>
