					<description><![CDATA[<p>Save significantly on incontinence care costs. Our reusable underpads draw moisture away from the body and prevent skin irritation. For adults seeking solutions to frequent incontinence problems due to weak or overactive bladders, stop stressful sleepless nights fighting your overactive bladder urges. Sleep better knowing you won't have to get up several times through-out the night to change the sheets. Multiple layers prevent wetness from spreading to the bed - the soft, 3-ply, quilted fabric works much like an egg crate and add a soft layer to firm mattresses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AT Surgical&#8217;s enviornmentally friendly Reusable Underpad is made for durability with a special 3-ply fabric construction:</p>
<ul>
<li>The top outer layer is created with soft wick material for whisking away moisture and assures maximum comfort.</li>
<li>The 2nd layer is a heavy-duty soaker with the ability to double it&#8217;s weight in absorbency. It&#8217;s crafted from a heavy-duty felt material specifically designed for absorbing body fluids.</li>
<li>The bottom layer is made from a special Fablon barrier we call Unishield &#8211; it is 100% waterproof and will never crack even after 200 washings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply lay one of AT Surgical&#8217;s Reusable Underpad Waterproof Mattress Liners on top of the sheets and remove when necessary. It&#8217;s also a great alternative to frequent laundry loads and is less wasteful than disposable incontinence products. You can even layer up the Reusable Underpad for additional protection. No matter what stage of life you&#8217;re in, our Reusable Underpad mattress protector offers the relief and peace of mind you need.</p>
