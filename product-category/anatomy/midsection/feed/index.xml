					<description><![CDATA[<p>The MkIV is the most competitive option for transmasculine folx. Designed &#38; iterated upon by an FTM during his pre-op days, this is the fourth version of the product.</p>
<p>We’ve replaced the previous material with a higher spandex-to-nylon ratio without sacrificing the compression of the original design. This medical grade Lycra® is softer to the touch than previous iterations for a longer wear-time.</p>
<p>For the best binder for your body, please make sure to follow the sizing instructions before ordering.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The AT Surgical Gait Belt / Transfer Belt is designed to be a heavy duty weight bearing belt that stays securely in place when fastened. Ensure a layer of clothing is between the patient’s skin and the belt to avoid abrasion. Keep resident as close as possible to caregiver during transfer. The proper way to apply it is to keep two fingers between the belt and the patient’s body. Tighten it until it has just enough room for your fingers. If the belt is too loose you could either have it slip upward and injure the patient’s chest (especially the female patient) or increase your risk for dropping them once the weight is put on the belt. A gait belt should never be used as a restraint or on patients with G-tubes and should be avoided with patients who have catheters.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>AT Surgical's Model 219 Universal 9" Tall Abdominal Binder with 3 Panels provides moderate support and compression to abdominal muscles weakened by strain without restricting breathing or muscle redevelopment. Types of abdominal strains are defined as a mild injury to the abdominal muscles resulting from trauma, overuse, pregnancy, inactivity, or surgeries such as cesarean, liposuction, or hysterectomy.</p>
<p>The universal braces come in three sizes with a larger range in sizing than the <a href="https://atsmanufacturing.github.io/oldat/product/abdominal-binder-9-tall-3-panel/">alternative</a>, giving the wearer greater versatility to find the best possible fit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Abdominal Binder is recommended for abdominal hernia reduction, postpartum recovery, bariatric support, and flattening and slimming of the abdomen. Conforms to body contour for support and proper compression, helping to speed recovery, increase circulation and reduce pain from movement or coughing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firmly holds dressings in proper position</li>

<li>Exclusive A-T Multiple Lock Stitch and high-quality fabric</li>

<blockquote><p><strong>About universal fit models:</strong></p>
<p><em>If you aren&#8217;t sure what size you need and fall between measurements, the universal belt offers greater flexibility in accommodating a range of sizes. Rather than coming in 4 standard &#8220;true fit&#8221; sizes, our universal models come in 2 sizes (Small &amp; Large) which are more generously cut to span across a wider range of sizes. For belts, wraps and binders, the universal model has a larger fastening panel for proper adjustment to achieve a customized fit.</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Small: 30&#8243; &#8211; 45&#8243; | Large: 45&#8243; &#8211; 60&#8243; | XLarge: 60&#8243; &#8211; 75&#8243;</h2>
